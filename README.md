This repository serves as an information platform where the developer shares his development experience, periodically updating the uploaded content to a newer one. Using one or another plugin is up to you. I will be glad to see users using my resources. You will also be able to share information and suggestions for improving my products with me.


## Content

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning for English speaking users

Unfortunately, most of my products use Russian. As a developer, I don't really know English, in order to avoid problems with the translator, I did not release my own products in several languages at once. I recommend that you translate the plugin in the configuration that I have provided for these cases before using it. Enjoy your use!


## **Conclusion**

My plugins have open source code for detailed analysis, I'm not hiding anything, and I don't plan to embroider any back doors, I'm sharing my own experience with you, not the purpose of fraud!

### üëã Good luck, and enjoy using it!
