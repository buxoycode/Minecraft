    This repository serves as an information platform where the developer shares his development experience, periodically updating the uploaded content to a newer one. Using one or another plugin is up to you. I will be glad to see users using my resources. You will also be able to share information and suggestions for improving my products with me.

<div>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">For my English-speaking users</p>

    ⚠️ Unfortunately, most of my products use Russian. As a developer, I don't really know English, in order to avoid problems with the translator, I did not release my own products in several languages at once. I recommend that you translate the plugin in the configuration that I have provided for these cases before using it. Enjoy your use!
